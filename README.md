# The Gouda Times aka. The Cheesy Times

### Try out the demo at https://thegoudatimes.sizableshrimp.me

A silly project which takes current event articles (from the New York Times API) and turns them into articles about cheese!
We used ChatGPT for title and article generation, Spring Boot for the backend, and Svelte for the frontend.
Python is used for AI prompting and article interaction.
A MySQL DB is used to store cheesified articles.
Docker and an Ubuntu VPS are used to run the website including the database, backend, and frontend.

## Features
* Read current event articles but in the theme of cheese
* Dark mode
